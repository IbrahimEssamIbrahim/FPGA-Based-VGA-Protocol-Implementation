# FPGA-Based-VGA-Protocol-Implementation

Developed as part of Anas Salah's FPGA course, this project involved creating a VGA protocol entirely from scratch. Key modules include:

- **Counters**
- **Clock Dividers**
- **Top-Level Module:** Orchestrates the overall protocol implementation

The project culminated in a graded color screen test to validate the design.
